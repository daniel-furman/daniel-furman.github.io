The key take-away: most companies outside of MAMAA/FAANG should strive to become Smart AI Integrators. Good news for you! - It’s never been easier to do so.<br><br>In a tooling-enabled world, integrating AI/ML largely comes down to the <strong>communication and execution of the right strategy</strong> amongst an effective data science team (one that&rsquo;s lean, talent-diversified, and collaborative). Read on for key tips on acing AI strategy, for the &ldquo;non-Googles of the world&rdquo; - along with links to resources (mostly other blog posts) from which I first came across each idea. The 4 tips within are my personal &ldquo;cream-of-the-crop&rdquo; selection of mantras and lessons-learned in applying AI, battle-tested productizing AI/ML tools as a data scientist in a digital strategy consulting firm.<br><br></p><h3 id=intro>Intro</h3><hr><p><br><br>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smart Integration&rdquo;? As Palumbo puts it, the Smart Integrator finds “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” Why should you care? When done correctly, the Smart Integrator reaps &ldquo;outsized returns&rdquo; on their AI/ML investment.<br><br>In contrast to the Smart Integrators, the Googles and MITs of the world are the players responsible for researching and developing innovative AI tools (they’re very good at doing this). Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced or productized as services, <strong>ripe for integration in your organization</strong>. And, over the last five to ten years, AI/ML tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical to apply.<br><br><br></p><ul><li>Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of computer/data science that largely concerns itself with the application of machine learning (ML) models for predictive tasks. Here, I refer to AI and ML synonymously. Common AI/ML tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.<br><br></li></ul><h3 id=1-on-scoping-know-when-ai-is-right-or-wrong-for-you-pre-development>1. On scoping: Know when AI is right (or wrong) for you, pre-development</h3><hr><p><br><br>AI is working well for your business when it&rsquo;s plugged into workstreams and generating bottom-line returns. You’ll know your AI integration is going particularly well if you can easily envision your tools generating value in five, ten years – i.e., you can credibly link your positioning of AI/ML tools to increased future cash flow.</p><p>How to get there? Machine learning models should be automating tasks, augmenting analyses, surfacing information, or be otherwise actively plugged in. If models are sitting idle, you’re not quite there yet. And, frequently, one of the reasons they are sitting idle is that the given use-case wasn’t truly viable (Cassie K., steps to an AI project).<br><br>It thus pays to be methodical when scoping the viability of an AI project, particularly of where it attaches within your business. You want to incorporate all voices across your team and think slowly about how well the tool “plugs in” to a given space.<br><br>With the right use-case in hand, integrating AI tools that people use (and love) becomes far more straightforward. To facilitate getting on this track, go with “low-hanging fruit” options at first, both in terms of commercial applicability and technical viability. You don&rsquo;t want users’ “first awesome experience” to be tarnished by poor-quality predictions. By going with a lower hanging fruit, you are guaranteeing that the tool can reach the “product success” threshold without too much fuss. You are therefore free to think diligently about how to best plug the tool into your organization’s commercial context.<br><br>Look for AI/ML solutions that can deliver the most business value in the near-to-medium-term future. Does your organization consistently do 250 deals of workstream A per year, and an AI tool can deliver insights in each engagement? Probably a good avenue to pursue. Oh, and perhaps it can plug into workstreams B and C as well in the not-so-distant future? Even better! Development in the “tooling-enabled age” is about finding the most valuable attach-points for AI in your business, whether they’re applied to your most important business workstream or relevant across multiple workstreams. Don’t overly concern yourself with the novelty of your AI/ML models. Instead, obsess over how to best productize tools by searching near and far for the most valuable attach-points for AI within your business. Once found, pounce.<br><br><br></p><h3 id=2-on-ideation-ai-and-data-analytics-pair-well>2. On ideation: AI and data analytics pair well</h3><hr><p><br><br>Not all companies’ workstreams lend themselves to automation. In lieu of fully automatable prediction tasks, aim to augment existing analytics with AI. Look for sources of alternative data.<br><br><br></p><h2 id=3-on-collaboration-spread-the-multi-disciplinary-mantra-to-every-dimension-of-your-project>3.

On productizing: Focus on trust and great user experiences</h3><hr><p><br><br>Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience.
