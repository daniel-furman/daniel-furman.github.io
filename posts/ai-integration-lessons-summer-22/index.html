It’s tailored to companies in the business of applying AI in the wild. Everyone outside of MAMAA/FAANG should strive to be a Smart Integrator.<br><br>As Palumbo puts it, the Smart Integrator finds “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” In contrast to these Smart Integrators, the Googles and MITs of the world are responsible for developing innovative AI tools (they’re very good at doing this). Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced or productized as services, <strong>ripe for integration in your organization</strong>. And, over the last five to ten years, these tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical.</p><p>So, it’s never been easier to be a Smart Integrator. In a tooling-enabled world, integrating AI largely comes down to the <strong>communication and execution of the right strategy</strong>. Here are 4 lessons I’ve learned on AI strategy.<br><br></p><ul><li>Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of computer science / data science that largely concerns the application of machine learning (ML) models for prediction tasks. Here, I refer to AI and ML synomously. Common AI/ML tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.<br><br></li></ul><h2 id=lesson-1-on-use-case-scoping-know-when-ai-is-right-or-wrong-pre-development>Lesson 1: On use-case scoping: Know when AI is right (or wrong) pre-development</h2><hr><p><br><br>AI is working well for your business when it&rsquo;s plugged into workstreams and generating bottom-line returns. Machine learning models should be busy automating tasks, augmenting analyses, surfacing information, or be actively engaged doing something else. If models are sitting idle, you’re not quite there yet. And, frequently, one of the reasons they are sitting idle is that the given use-case wasn’t truly viable (Cassie K., steps to an AI project).<br><br>It thus pays to be methodical when scoping the viability of an AI project, particularly on where it attaches within your business. Incorporate all voices across your team. Think slowly about how well the tool “plugs in” to a given commercial context. The scoping phase is, in my opinion, where a project is made or broken.<br><br>With the right use-case in hand, integrating AI tools that people use (and love) becomes far more straightforward. To facilitate getting on this track, go with “low-hanging fruit” options at first, both in terms of commercial applicability and technical viability. You don&rsquo;t want users’ “first awesome experience” to be tarnished by poor-quality predictions. By going with a low-hanging fruit, you’re guaranteeing that the model can reach the “product success” threshold without too much fuss. You are therefore free to think diligently about how to best plug in the tool in the commercial context.<br><br>Above all else, look for AI solutions that can deliver the most business value. Does your organization do 250 deals of workstream A per year, and an AI tool can deliver value solidly to each engagement? Oh, and perhaps it can plug it into workstreams B and C as well? Probably a good avenue to pursue. Development in the “tooling-enabled age” is about finding the most valuable attach-points for AI in your commercial workstreams. Don’t overly concern yourself with the novelty of your models. Instead, obsess over how to best productize your tool. Search near and far for the most valuable attach-points within your business. Once found, pounce.<br><br><br></p><h2 id=lesson-2-on-ideating-solutions-ai-and-data-analytics-pair-well>Lesson 2: On ideating solutions: AI and data analytics pair well</h2><hr><p><br><br>Not all companies’ workstreams lend themselves to automation. In lieu of fully automatable prediction tasks, aim to augment existing analytics with AI. Look for sources of alternative data.<br><br><br></p><h2 id=lesson-3-on-team-structure-spread-the-multi-disciplinary-mantra-to-every-dimension-of-your-project>Lesson 3: On team structure: Spread the “multi-disciplinary” mantra to every dimension of your project</h2><hr><p><br><br></p><h2 id=lesson-4-on-product-development-focus-on-great-user-experiences>Lesson 4: On product development: Focus on great user experiences</h2><hr><p><br><br>Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience.
