Made with the support of the Risk &amp;amp; Resilience DAT/Artathon 2021.
“EcoRisk California” visualizes climate change impacts for three of the West Coast’s most beloved tree species during the 21st century. The motion-graphics storyboard visualizes shifts within three species distributions across spatial and climate dimensions, exploring relationships between ecological risk and habitat suitability. To facilitate future experiments, the study is accompanied by an open-sourced Python package containing the class for semi-automated machine learning used in the visualization.</description></item><item><title>BirdCLEF21 Kaggle Competition Write Up.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/birdclef21-kaggle-competition-write-up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/birdclef21-kaggle-competition-write-up/</guid><description>BirdCLEF21 Kaggle Competition Write Up. [Code] Bird song recognition with AI has the potential to streamline (by semi-automating) scientific monitoring of bird assemblages. Faster identification of bird species in natural settings, as a result, equips land managers and policy-makers with a stronger understanding of environmental risks in ecological systems. The BirdCLEF21 Kaggle challenge brought state of the art in computer vision to bird song recognition, tasking competitors to classify species from bird calls into 397 target classes.</description></item><item><title>Numerical Math Mondays: Approximating the golden ratio.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</guid><description>Numerical Math Mondays: Approximating the golden ratio.
Introduction and historical context I am going to approximate the golden ratio with numerical methods, by iteratively taking ratios of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence. This algorithm lets us peer into the underlying relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, helping us understand many interesting mathematical applications. For more reading on applications, see the Appendix.
For a little background: What is the golden ratio anyways?</description></item><item><title>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:22:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</guid><description>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes. Consider a partnership restructuring its assets. The N partners currently share each of the M assets at a given percentage. Our task is to re-distribute the assets such that each is under majority ownership. Critically, we need to divvy the assets without altering the overall value and debt associated with each partner. In effect, we want to split up the assets fairly.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/owgr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/owgr/</guid><description>Does the Official World Golf Rankings (OGWR) company fairly rank professional golfers? I cultivated valuable insights analyzing this question during my Junior year of college, tasked to employ the data science techniques I had learned in my undergraduate coursework at the University of Pennsylvania. My background in competitive golf was well-suited for ensuring accuracy in the OGWR data, as well as for investigating the underlying fairness (University of Pennsylvania Varsity golf team ‘16-17, Harvard-Westlake School team captain ‘15-16).</description></item></channel></rss>
