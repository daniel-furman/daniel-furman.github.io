Made with the support of the Risk &amp;amp; Resilience DAT/Artathon 2021.
“EcoRisk California” explores climate change impacts for three of the West Coast’s most beloved tree species during the 21st century. The motion-graphics storyboard visualizes shifts within three species distributions across spatial and climate dimensions, exploring relationships between ecological risk and habitat suitability. To facilitate future experiments, the study is accompanied by an open-sourced Python package containing the class for semi-automated machine learning used in the visualization.</description></item><item><title>BirdCLEF21 Kaggle Competition Write Up.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/birdclef21-kaggle-competition-write-up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/birdclef21-kaggle-competition-write-up/</guid><description>BirdCLEF21 Kaggle Competition Write Up. [Code] Bird song recognition with AI has the potential to streamline (by semi-automating) scientific monitoring of bird assemblages. Faster identification of bird species in natural settings, as a result, equips land managers and policy-makers with a stronger understanding of environmental risks in ecological systems.
The BirdCLEF21 Kaggle challenge brought state of the art in computer vision to bird song recognition, tasking competitors to classify species from bird calls into 397 target classes.</description></item><item><title>Using Numerical Mathematics to Approximate the Golden Ratio.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</guid><description>Using Numerical Mathematics to Approximate the Golden Ratio
Introduction and historical context I will approximate the golden ratio by iteratively taking ratios of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence. This algorithm lets us peer into the underlying relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, illuminating a number of interesting patterns.
The golden ratio is a mathematical phenomenon between two numbers, say, a and b. Let a &amp;gt; b, if the ratio of \(\frac{a}{b}\) is the same as \(\frac{(a+b)}{a}\), then the ratio is ~\(\frac{1.</description></item><item><title>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:22:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</guid><description>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes. Intro Consider a partnership restructuring its assets into majority ownerships among N partners, who previously shared M assets unevenly (debt + value). The asset structure directly reflects the partners' differing ownership stakes in the business. Here, I aimed to re-distribute the assets into majority ownerships without altering the partnership stakes, minimizing potential restructuring taxes levied if the asset ownerships changed significantly between partners.</description></item></channel></rss>
