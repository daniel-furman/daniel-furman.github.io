The intended audience includes data practitioners (DS, DE, etc.), technologists, and business executives - as both technical and non-technical roles touch AI strategy.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s why AI innovation teams should exude the mentality of a technology startup, from the perspective of a Bay Area data scientist in strategy consulting.</p><p><br><br></p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><hr><p><br><br></p><p>The parallels between technology startups and digital transformation are numerous. In both, the overarching goal is to create value through new applications of technology. And, today, integrating AI tools is more frequently a component of digital transformation (and, as it turns out, technology startups). According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, companies of all shapes and sizes are posed to find a &ldquo;competitive advantage&rdquo; through the “Smart Integration” of AI tools today [1]. And, while this trend is largely enabled by improvements in the open-source and subscription-tools landscape, the commercial viability of AI innovation continues to hinge on value creation fundamentals.</p><blockquote><p>The &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; startup in a VC fund is more valuable than all others (in the fund) combined.<br><br><strong>Similarly, an AI tool plugged into the &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; use-case creates more value than all other options combined</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The salient question becomes: What is the most promising opportunity for AI integration given the commercial context?</p><p>In this blog post, I argue that applying “technology startup fundamentals” to AI development helps your team attend to that question early on and often throughout a project. While no silver bullet, this methodology lets you frame AI innovation projects as a business plan, with the hope of finding the strongest opportunities for value creation. This lets you avoid “bad luck” during development (and, usually, helps you win buy-in from executives).</p><p><br><br></p><h2 id=a-primer-on-ai>A primer on AI</h2><hr><p><br><br>First, what’s AI and machine learning anyways? While you’ve probably heard of Artificial Intelligence, let’s clearly define its practical meaning in digital transformation. AI refers to computer programs that automate predictive tasks. In other words, they’re automatic data labelers. Some common examples include: What’s the sentiment of a tweet? What’s contained in an image? What’s the meaning of a phrase in a different language? For such tasks, there often is <strong>not</strong> a set of pre-defined rules a computer program can use to make good predictions (if-else/and-or rules are tenants of “traditional” computer programming). Instead, most of today’s AI tools rely on machine learning (ML) models for prediction, the brainchild of a different field from computer science, the field of statistical learning.</p><p>For more background on AI/ML, see the appendix section.<br><br><br></p><h2 id=mapping-startup-fundamentals-to-ai-strategy>Mapping startup fundamentals to AI strategy</h2><br>* Note, all italicized quotes come from Chapter 13 of Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One [2]<hr><p><br><br></p><p><strong>1 - The People Question</strong></p><p>“<em>Do you have the right team?</em>”</p><p>“<em>Real technologists wear T-shirts and jeans [not suits]</em>”</p><p>“So much of innovation is about the quality of people and culture you have.

These patterns correspond to correlations between model features (the dataset) and the outcome (the label prediction) and are specific to the training dataset employed. Google’s Cassie Kozykrov likens training a machine learning model to a chef learning a recipe. This is a great analogy: in the case of a Twitter sentiment model, the model is following a recipe that it “learned” about positivity versus negativity in tweets, one that is based on the factors that drove sentiment in the historical tweets at hand. TL;DR: it’s following a recipe.</p><p>An ML model is really only capable of making sound predictions on new data when things closely resemble the dataset it was trained on. This &ldquo;generalization problem&rdquo; is one of the most impactful, pervasive, and talked about constraints of AI and machine learning today. The ramifications: the importance of training datasets cannot be exaggerated. You need great datasets to develop AI tools. In our tooling-enabled world, everyone mostly has access to the same types of models. Common ones include XGBoost, a tree-based architecture for tabular data, and Transformers, a Neural Net architecture for natural language and computer vision. Both of these models are used by practically every player in enterprise data science. Interestingly, most of the state-of-the-art, truly massive models developed by the Microsofts of the world (the ones that are on the top of benchmark leaderboards such as <a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://super.gluebenchmark.com/>SuperGLUE</a> for natural language processing) are <strong>not</strong> efficient enough in terms of latency to deploy in most commercial settings. So, even though these proprietary models may appear superior if you glance at benchmark leaderboards, they aren’t efficient enough to scale in the wild.</p><p>Model algorithms don’t differentiate integrators of AI/ML. The leaders of AI integration are rather differentiated by their datasets (quality, scope, signal, commercial value, governance, importance/relevance to important business functions, etc.). The old adage “more data beats better models, but better data beats more data” is a core tenant of enterprise AI. For example, if you wanted to develop an AI/ML tool that predicts customer health dynamics (like churn), you’d first need to invest in the data stack that can collect such customer datasets specific to your business in the first place (see “Timing Question” above).</p><p><br><br></p><h2 id=citations>Citations</h2><hr><p><br><br></p><p>[1] S.
