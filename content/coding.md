## Daniel's Code

---

[`RecFeatureSelect`](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | See the [docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/RecFeatureSelect) for more info. 

* A from-scratch feature selection algorithm based on a correlation threshold and feature importance scores. The function is based on recursion. 

[`lwMCMC`](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | See the [docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/lwMCMC) for more info. 

* Object-oriented Bayesian inference classes for MCMC parameter space sampling, with options to compare a from-scratch random walk NumPy implementation with the PyMC3 Hamiltonian approach. 

[`PySDMs`](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | See the [docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) for more info. 

* An object-oriented Python class for geospatial species distribution modeling. Contains an AutoML pipeline with options for comparing BRTs, NNs, and soft voter geo-classifiers.
