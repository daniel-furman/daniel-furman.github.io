[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Recursive functions for feature selection with (1) spearman correlations to the target and [Forward Stepwise Selection](https://quantifyinghealth.com/stepwise-selection/) with rf, (2) spearman [multi-collinearity](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/10/5-concepts-data-scientist-should-know.html) and a feature ranking, starting with the most correlated pairs and proceeding to a threshold, and (3) a blend of (1) and (2).
[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | An object-oriented class for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html) Hamiltonian wrapper. 
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented class for [Species Distribution Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution_modelling), which contains a semi-AutoML pipeline comparing BRT, NN, and soft voters for geo-classification.
