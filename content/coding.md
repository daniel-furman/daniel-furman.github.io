[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Functions for feature selection (1) using [Forward Stepwise Selection](https://quantifyinghealth.com/stepwise-selection/) with hyper-param optimized random forest using rankings from feature correlations to the target (2) using spearman multi-collinearity and a feature importance rankings, recursively starting with the most correlated pairs and proceeding to a threshold.
[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | An object-oriented class for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html) Hamiltonian wrapper. 
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented class for [Species Distribution Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution_modelling), which contains a semi-AutoML pipeline comparing BRT, NN, and soft voters for geo-classification.
