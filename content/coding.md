[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Recursively designed feature selectors. Functions for 1) feature selection based on the strongest target spearman correlations, with FSS fitting, 2) multicollinearity removal based on modeling importance scores and their spearman correlations, and 3) a blend of (1) and (2). 
[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | An object-oriented class for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html) Hamiltonian wrapper. 
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented class for [Species Distribution Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution_modelling), which contains a semi-AutoML pipeline comparing BRT, NN, and soft voters for geo-classification.
