[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Recursively designed feature selectors. Functions for 1) feature selection based on the strongest target correlations, with FSS training and 2) feature removal based on modeling importance scores and their multicollinearity. 
[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | An object-oriented class for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html) Hamiltonian wrapper. 
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented Python class for [Species Distribution Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution_modelling), which contains an AutoML geo-classification pipeline that compares BRT, NN, and soft voter learners.
