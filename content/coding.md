[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Functions for feature selection (1) using rankings from feature correlation to the target with FSS on a hyper-param optimized sklearn ensemble tree-based learner (2) using spearman multi-collinearity and pre-calculated feature importances as the rankings, recursively starting with the most correlated pair and proceeding to the spearman threshold.
[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | A parameter space sampling class for lightweight Bayesian inference. Running on a NumPy-based implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented Python class for semi-auto ML geo-classification (running on PyCaret). Compares gradient boosted tree algorithms by default, with options to include soft voters and NNs. Designed for Species Distribution Modeling applications.
