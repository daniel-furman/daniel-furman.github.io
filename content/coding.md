[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Recursively designed model selection functions for 1) selection based on the features' spearman correlation with the target variable, employing Forward Stepwise Selection [FSS fitting](https://quantifyinghealth.com/stepwise-selection/), 2) selection based on Random Forest feature importance scores and the features' [multi-collinearity](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/10/5-concepts-data-scientist-should-know.html), starting with the most correlated pair and proceeding to a spearman threshold, and 3) a blend of (1) and (2). 
[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | An object-oriented class for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html) Hamiltonian wrapper. 
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented class for [Species Distribution Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution_modelling), which contains a semi-AutoML pipeline comparing BRT, NN, and soft voters for geo-classification.
