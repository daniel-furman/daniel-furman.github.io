[lwMCMC](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | A parameter space sampling class for lightweight Bayesian inference. Running on a NumPy-based implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
[PySDMs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | An object-oriented Python class for semi-auto ML geo-classification (running on PyCaret). Compares gradient boosted tree algorithms by default, with options to include soft voters and NNs. Designed for Species Distribution Modeling applications. 
[RecFeatureSelect](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | Feature selection functions (1) using the multi-collinearity matrix and recursively proceeding to a spearman threshold and (2) using Forward Stepwise Selection running on an ensemble sklearner (with options for HPO).
