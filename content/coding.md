[`RecFeatureSelect`](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | [Docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/RecFeatureSelect)

* A feature selection function removing [multi-collinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) for ML experiments, employing an upper bound correlation threshold and feature importance scores. Based on a from-scratch recursive algorithm. 

[`lwMCMC`](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | [Docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/lwMCMC)

* Object-oriented Bayesian inference classes for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a PyMC3 Hamiltonian implementation. 

[`PySDMs`](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | [Docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs). 

* An object-oriented Python class for [Species Distribution Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution_modelling), containing an AutoML pipeline with options for comparing BRTs, NNs, and soft voter geo-classifiers.
