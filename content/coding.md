[`RecFeatureSelect`](https://pypi.org/project/RecFeatureSelect/) | [Docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/RecFeatureSelect)

* A feature selection function employing a correlation threshold and feature importance scores. Built from a from-scratch algorithm based on recursion. 

[`lwMCMC`](https://pypi.org/project/lwMCMC/) | [Docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/lwMCMC)

* Object-oriented Bayesian inference classes for MCMC parameter space sampling with two [Metropolis-Hastings](http://www.mit.edu/~ilkery/papers/MetropolisHastingsSampling.pdf) options: a from-scratch NumPy implementation and a PyMC3 Hamiltonian implementation. 

[`PySDMs`](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs) | [Docs](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs). 

* An object-oriented Python class for geospatial species distribution modeling. Contains an AutoML pipeline with options for comparing BRTs, NNs, and soft voter geo-classifiers.
