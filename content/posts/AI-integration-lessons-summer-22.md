In April 2022, Silvio Palumbo wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/bcggamma/smart-integration-four-levels-of-ai-maturity-and-why-its-ok-to-be-at-level-3-2af0c94c9614">blog</a> about “Smart Integration” – a playbook of sorts on how to ace commercial AI strategy. It’s tailored to companies that are in the business of applying AI solutions. Everyone outside of MAMAA/FAANG should strive to be a Smart Integrator.
<br><br>
As Palumbo puts it, the Smart Integrator finds “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” In contrast to the Smart Integrators, the Googles of the world are responsible for developing innovative tools that expand the AI landscape. Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced or productized as services, **ripe for integration in your organization**. And, over the last five to ten years, such tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical to use.

* Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of computer science / data science that largely concerns the application of machine learning (ML) models for prediction tasks. Machine learning tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.
<br><br>
It’s never been easier to be a Smart Integrator. Thus, in a tooling-enabled world, integrating AI largely comes down to the **communication and execution of the right strategy**. Here's 4 lessons learned on how to nail AI strategy. 
<br><br>
## Lesson 1: On scoping use-cases: Know when AI is right (or wrong) pre-development
---
<br><br>
AI is working well when it's plugged into commercial workstreams and generating value. Machine learning models should be automating tasks, augmenting analyses, surfacing information, or be otherwise actively engaged. If models are sitting idle, you’re not quite there yet. And, frequently, the reason they are sitting idle is that the use-case wasn’t viable in the first place (Cassie K., steps to an AI project).
<br><br>
It thus pays to be methodical when scoping the viability of an AI project. Incorporate all voices across your team. Think slowly about how the tool plugs in given the context. The scoping phase is, in my opinion, where a project is made or broken. Treat it as such.
<br><br>
With the right use-case, integrating AI into a tool that people use (and love) becomes far more straightforward. To facilitate getting on this track, go with options that are more “low-hanging fruit” at first, both in terms of commercial application and technical implementation. You don't want users’ “first awesome experience” to be tarnished by poor-quality predictions. By going with a “low-hanging fruit”, you’re guaranteeing that the model can reach the “product success” threshold without too much fuss. You are therefore free to think diligently about how to best plug in the tool in the commercial context, which is often the lifeline to project success. 
<br><br>
Oh, and look for AI solutions that can deliver the most value (sounds obvious, right?). Eyeing the opportunities with **high-value proposition is more important than "proprietary"**. Does your business do 250 deals of workstream A a year, and an AI tool can deliver greenfield value to each engagement? Oh, and perhaps it can plug it into workstreams B and C as well? Probably a good avenue to pursue development for. It’s certainly a better avenue to pursue compared with a tool that is tailored specifically to workstream D, which occurs less frequently than the others. Yes, this holds true despite whether or not there’s a difference in the IP value of the underlying machine learning models. In most cases, better to focus on tools that plugs in well across your company’s business.

## Lesson 2: On ideating solutions: AI and data analytics pair well
---
<br><br>
In lieu of fully automatable workstreams, aim to augment existing analytics with alternative data and machine learning. Data quality over data quantity, most of the time.
<br><br>
## Lesson 3: On team structure: Spread the “multi-disciplinary” mantra to every dimension of your project
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 4: On product development: Focus on great user experiences
---
<br><br>
Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience. Build trusted products
