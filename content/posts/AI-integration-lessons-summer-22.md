# 5 lessons learned applying 'Smart Integration' in AI/ML development.
---


<br><br>
In April 2022, Silvio Palumbo wrote a blog post about “Smart Integration” – a playbook of sorts on how to nail organizational AI strategy. The playbook is tailored to companies vying to rise to the cream of the crop as integrators of AI. 
* Definitions: AI refers to Artificial Intelligence, a sub-field of computer science and data science that concerns the crafting of machine learning (ML) models for a certain predictive task. Here, we will refer to AI/ML interchangeably and synonymously.  
<br><br>
As Palumbo puts it, the Smart Integrator find “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” 
<br><br>
Basically, everyone outside of MAMAA/FAANG should strive to be a Smart Integrator.
<br><br>
What differentiates MAMAA/FAANG from the Smart Integrators? The Googles of the world – along with Academia (think UC Berkeley or MIT) – represent the primary researchers. They are responsible for developing the innovative tools that power today’s AI technologies. Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced (such as Apache Spark, Airflow, PyTorch) or productized as services (such as AWS, Databricks, Snowflake), ripe for integration in your organization. And, over the last five to ten years, such tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical to apply in commercial use-cases. 
<br><br>
In a tooling enabled world, integrating AI well in commercial settings comes down to executing a well-communicated strategy, one with sound “Smart Integration” fundamentals. Here’s a few lessons I’ve learned so far as a data scientist applying these ideas to develop AI products. 
<br><br>
## Lesson 1: Scope use-cases with the right kind of commercial viability

The  in an “NLP Accelerator” project during the summer of 2022. 

* Definitions: NLP is an acronym for Natural Language Processing, the domain of AI concerned with all manners of natural language predictive tasks. While gleaned through the lens of NLP development, these 5 lessons are designed to generalize across the AI landscape, whether your given problem concerns tabular Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Speech + Audio Recognition, or any other flavor of AI. 
<br><br>

## Lesson 1: Scope use-cases with the right kind of commercial viability
---
<br><br>

Choose those that are poised to have outsized returns , those that are applicable across workstreams and disciplines, and those that are proven to be viable from a technical standpoint.
<br><br>
## Lesson 2: Spread the “multi-disciplinary” mantra to every level of your team
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 3: Evolve in waves with a culture of experimentation
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 4: Build trusted products that people want
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 5: Focus on great user experiences
---
<br><br>
Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience.
