# 5 lessons learned applying 'Smart Integration' in AI/ML development.

In April 2022, Silvio Palumbo wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/bcggamma/smart-integration-four-levels-of-ai-maturity-and-why-its-ok-to-be-at-level-3-2af0c94c9614">blog</a> about “Smart Integration” – a playbook of sorts on how to nail commercial AI/ML** strategy. The Smart Integration playbook is tailored to companies vying to rise to the cream of the crop in the business of applying AI. And, if your business is looking to embrace AI, the Smart Integration ideas are relevant to your executives, engineers, managers, and, yes, just about everybody else too. 
<br><br>
* ** Definitions: AI refers to Artificial Intelligence, a sub-field of computer science and data science that concerns the crafting of machine learning (ML) models for certain predictive tasks. These include predicting the next word in a text, recognizing hate speech or misinformation online, translating between languages, etc., the list of use-cases is steadily growing. Here, we will refer to AI and ML, or AI/ML, interchangeably and synonymously.  
<br><br>
As Palumbo puts it, the Smart Integrator finds “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” 
<br><br>
Basically, everyone outside of MAMAA/FAANG should strive to be a Smart Integrator.
<br><br>
What differentiates MAMAA/FAANG from the Smart Integrators? The Googles of the world – along with Academia (think UC Berkeley or MIT) – represent the primary researchers. They are responsible for developing the innovative tools that power today’s AI technologies. Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced (such as Apache Spark, Airflow, PyTorch) or productized as services (such as AWS, Databricks, Snowflake), ripe for integration in your organization. And, over the last five to ten years, such tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical to apply. 
<br><br>
In a tooling-enabled world, integrating AI well in commercial use-cases largely comes down to the communication and execution of the "Smart Integration" strategy, one with sound fundamentals and with buy-in across the board. Here are a few lessons I’ve learned applying these ideas in an attempt to develop AI/ML solutions that people love. 
<br><br>

## Lesson 1: Prioritize use-cases that deliver value widely 

---
<br><br>
It's true, AI solutions can yield outsized returns for your business – when models are working for you. AI is working for you when it's delivering value to the most people in your organization. Machine learning models should be automating tasks, augmenting workstreams, or otherwise creating value. If sitting ideal in research mode, they aren't of much use to your digital transformation. And, a key difference between integrating AI versus researching methods is that your commercial model only needs to be performant enough to the given threshold of product "success", no higher. You don't want to get trapped searching for use-cases where the primary value proposition is how proprietary or accurate a model could be. You also don't want to get trapped developing models for unproven use-cases where reaching the requisite performance threshold may be difficult. If you're crafting a vanilla sentiment analysis tool, it may not matter so much whether your model is 92% or 94% accurate. What matters is whether or not it's able to be plugged into your workstreams well or not. But, if you’re crafting a predictive model for a less tested domain, it better be accurate enough – and some domains are too difficult or otherwise non-applicable to AI technology today. You don’t want users' “first awesome experience” being tarnished by models with poor-quality predictions. 

In short, go for tools that are more low-hanging fruit items. Another key to use-case scoping is finding ideas that can permeate across your company's workstreams.

## Lesson 2: Spread the “multi-disciplinary” mantra to every level of your team

<br><br>
## Lesson 3: Evolve in waves with a culture of experimentation
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 4: Build trusted products 
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 5: Focus on great user experiences
---
<br><br>
Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience.
