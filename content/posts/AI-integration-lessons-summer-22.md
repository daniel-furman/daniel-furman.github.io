In April 2022, Silvio Palumbo wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/bcggamma/smart-integration-four-levels-of-ai-maturity-and-why-its-ok-to-be-at-level-3-2af0c94c9614">blog</a> about “Smart Integration” – a playbook of sorts on how to nail commercial AI/ML** strategy. The Smart Integration strategy is tailored to companies vying to become cream of the crop in the business of applying AI. And, if your business is looking to embrace AI, the Smart Integration ideas are relevant to your whole team, your executives, engineers, managers, and, yes, just about everybody else too.

* ** Definitions: AI refers to Artificial Intelligence, a sub-field of computer science and data science that concerns the crafting of machine learning (ML) models for certain predictive tasks. These include predicting the next word in a text, recommending friends on a social media platform, recognizing hate speech or misinformation online, translating between languages, etc., the list of use-cases is steadily growing. Here, we will refer to AI and ML, or AI/ML, interchangeably and synonymously.  
<br><br>
As Palumbo puts it, the Smart Integrator finds “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” 
<br><br>
Basically, everyone outside of MAMAA/FAANG should strive to be a Smart Integrator.
<br><br>
What differentiates MAMAA/FAANG from the Smart Integrators? The Googles of the world – along with Academia (think UC Berkeley or MIT) – are primary research players. They are responsible for developing innovative tools that power AI technologies. Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced (such as Apache Spark, Airflow, PyTorch) or productized as services (such as AWS, Databricks, Snowflake), ripe for integration in your organization. And, over the last five to ten years, such tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical to apply. 
<br><br>
In a tooling-enabled world, integrating AI well in commercial use-cases largely comes down to the communication and execution of the right strategy. Here are a few lessons I’ve learned applying Smart Integration as a high-level strategy to develop AI/ML solutions that people love. 
<br><br>

## Lesson 1: Prioritize use-cases, not models

---
<br><br>
AI solutions can yield outsized returns, yes – when models are in deployment. AI is working for you when it's plugged into workstreams. AI models should be automating tasks, augmenting analyses, or otherwise creating value. If sitting ideal in research mode, you’re not quite there yet. 
<br><br>
Luckily, it’s easier to integrate solutions than innovate them. 
<br><br>
A key difference between integrating AI versus innovating is that commercial solutions only needs to be performant to the given threshold of "success", and no higher. And, for commercial products, there indeed can be multiple dimensions to success. Accuracy, latency, trustworthiness, compute requirements, the list goes on. If the model is performant enough along the relevant dimensions, get the model into production, and start squeezing value out of it! If it isn't performant enough, don't roll it out. While seemingly simple guidelines, it can be difficult to pinpoint where "performant enough" lies for the given situation. It can also be difficult to abandon ideas that people are particularly married to for one reason or another. Given these rules, at first, go for tools that are more “low-hanging fruit” over “next-generation”, both in terms of commercial applicability and technical viability. You don't want to get trapped developing for use-cases where the primary value proposition is how proprietary a model could be. The magic sauce isn’t the model’s accuracy score. Integrating AI is about the value of plugging a model into a given application. For example, if you're crafting a tool that augments an analytics workstream, it may not matter so much whether your model is 87%, 92% or 94% accurate in production. What matters is whether or not the modeling outputs can be plugged in to generate greenfield insights for the analysis (or not). That’s not to say model accuracy doesn’t matter. You don't want to start developing models for unproven use-cases where reaching the requisite performance threshold is likely to be difficult. This is because you don't want users’ “first awesome experience” to be tarnished by poor-quality predictions. 
<br><br>
Another key to use-case scoping is finding ideas that can permeate across your company's different workstreams. A product that can deliver value for more engagements is working for more people in your organization. The most valuable tools are the often ones that have the potential to generalize across your business functions. But it’s not simply about finding a diversity of plug-ins. Does your business do 150 deals of workstream A, and an AI tool can deliver greenfield value to each engagement? Probably a better avenue to pursue than a product that is only relevant to workstreams B, C, and D that would perhaps go unused because those particular workstreams didn’t occur as frequently as workstream A. In short, it pays to be methodical and incorporate all voices across your team when scoping commercial value and viability. It can make or break any AI project.

## Lesson 2: Data quality over everything else
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 3: Spread the “multi-disciplinary” mantra to every level of your team
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 4: Build trusted products 
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 5: Focus on great user experiences
---
<br><br>
Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience.
