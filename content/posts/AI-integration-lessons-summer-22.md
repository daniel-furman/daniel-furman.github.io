# 5 lessons learned applying the fundamentals of “Smart Integration” in an AI project 
---
<br><br>
In April 2022, Silvio Palumbo wrote a blog post about “Smart Integration” – a playbook of sorts on how to nail your organization’s AI strategy. The strategies detailed within are tailored for companies vying to become cream of the crop adopters of AI. 

As Palumbo puts it, these players find “competitive advantage by orchestrating tools and AI applications that have been developed by other specialized organizations, and then directing the tools to fit their specific data, technology, and talent context.” 

Basically, everyone outside of MAMAA/FAANG. 

What differentiates MAMAA/FAANG? In contrast to Smart Integrators, the Googles of the world – along with Academia (think UC Berkeley or MIT) – represent the primary researchers responsible for developing the innovative, next-generation tools that power AI technology. And, over the last five to ten years, such tools have become far more performant, scalable, diversified, and economical to apply. These recent advances have opened the flood gates for AI adoption. And, MAMAA/FAANG players are in a league of their own when it comes to state-of-the-art innovation. Fortuitously, many of these tools are open-sourced (Apache Spark, Airflow, PyTorch) or productized as services (AWS, Databricks, Snowflake), ripe for integration in your organization. And, while advances in tooling certainly help, integrating AI in commercial settings requires a well-communicated strategy with sound fundamentals.  

Here’s what I learned as a data scientist applying Smart Integration in our “NLP Accelerator” project this summer at West Monroe. 


## Lesson 1: Scope use-cases with wide commercial promise
---
<br><br>
Choose those that are poised to have outsized returns, those that are applicable across workstreams and disciplines, and those that are proven to be viable from a technical standpoint.

## Lesson 2: Become multi-disciplinary at every level of your team
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 3: Evolve in waves with a culture of experimentation
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 4: Build trusted products that people want
---
<br><br>
## Lesson 5: Focus on great user experiences
---
<br><br>
Even at the v0 prototype stage, make sure to share your “final product” vision with beta users. And, for your v0 product, ensure enough energy and attention were given to the user experience.
