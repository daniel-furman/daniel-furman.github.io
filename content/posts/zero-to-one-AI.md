In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The key takeaway: startups should exude seven pivotal fundamentals – otherwise, red flags. Here's why this "startup mentality" is also relevant to productizing AI solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

It's not difficult to see the parallels between founding a technology startup and a digital transformation. In both cases, you're setting out to generate untapped value through the application of technology. Today, integrating AI tools is more frequently an aspect of digital transformation (developing or buying solutions). According to Silvio Palumbo, a data science consultant at BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the “smart integration” of AI tools (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). 

Indeed, the significant advances in AI and machine learning (AI/ML) tooling have enabled the rise of these "smart integrators". And, while enabled by tooling, the commercial success of AI integration usually hinges on the product(s)'s ability to generate untapped value for the business. When plugged into the right use-case, AI models can create greenfield value by automating tasks at scale, powering new features, augmenting analyses, surfacing important information, or by otherwise making predictions in the wild that are useful to the business. If models sit idle, you’re AI integration is not quite there yet. And, frequently AI projects fail because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation). 

The salient question thus becomes: What are the most valuable "unicorn" opportunities for AI integration given the commercial context? 

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI integration projects goes a long way in enabling your team to answer that critical question well. Ultimately, developing AI tools with these seven startup fundamentals in mind results in more value creation for your business, an AI projects' lifeline to commercial success (and, usually, buy-in from executives).
