In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The key takeaway: startups should exude seven pivotal fundamentals – otherwise, red flags. Here's why this "startup mentality" is also relevant to productizing AI solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

It's not difficult to see the parallels between technology startups and digital transformation. In both cases, the goal is to generate untapped value through the application of technology. And, today, integrating AI tools is more frequently a piece of digital transformation. According to Silvio Palumbo, a data science consultant at BCG Gamma, most companies in the 2020's are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the “smart integration” of AI tools (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). 

Indeed, advances in AI and machine learning (AI/ML) have enabled the rise of the "smart integrator". And, while enabled by better tooling, the bottom-line commercial success of an AI integration hinges on whether or not the models can generate untapped value for the business (wether the project was undertaken ten years ago or today). Just because you're able to integrate an AI solution with today's state-of-the-art performance doesn't mean it's the most valuable tool to develop in the commercial context. AI models generate exponentially more untapped value when plugged into that "unicorn" use-case, just as the "unicorn" startup in a VC fund is more valuable than all others combined. 

The salient question thus becomes: What is the most valuable opportunity for an AI integration given the commercial context? 

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI/ML development enables your team to answer that question early on and throughout a project. Ultimately, developing tools with these seven startup fundamentals in mind results in stronger and more conistent opportunities for value creation, the lifeline to commercial success in digital transformation (and, usually, buy-in from executives).

They can be automating tasks at scale, powering new features, augmenting analyses, surfacing important information, or otherwise making predictions in the wild that are useful to workstreams. If models sit idle, you’re AI integration is not quite there yet. And, frequently AI projects fail because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation).
