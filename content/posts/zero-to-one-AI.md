In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the core fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The takeaway: startups should exude seven pivotal traits – otherwise, queue red flags. Here's why your data science team should also exude the mentality of a technology startup to win at AI innovation, from the perspective of a data scientist in digital strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

The parallels between technology startups and digital transformation are numerous. In both, the overarching goal is to create value through novel applications of technology. And, today, integrating AI tools is more frequently a component of digital transformation (and, as it turns out, technology startups). According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, companies of all shapes and sizes are posed to find a "competitive advantage" through the “Smart Integration” of AI tools in the 2020s (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). 

And, while this trend is largely enabled by improvements in the open-source/subscription AI development space, the bottom-line success of AI innovation continues to hinge on value creation fundamentals (like any digital transformation). Just as the "unicorn" startup in a VC fund is more valuable than all others in the fund combined, AI models plugged into the "unicorn" use-case create more value than all other potential tools/applications/solutions combined. 

The salient question becomes: What is the most promising opportunity for AI integration given the commercial context? 

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI development helps your team attend to that question early on and often throughout a project. Ultimately, developing tools with these seven fundamentals in mind results in products that have stronger and more consistent opportunities for value creation, the lifeline to success in AI innovation (and, usually, buy-in from executives).

## A primer on AI

First, what’s AI anyways? While you’ve probably heard of Artificial Intelligence, let’s clearly define its practical meaning in digital transformation and innovation. AI refers to computer programs that automate predictive tasks. Some common examples include: What’s the sentiment of a tweet? What’s contained in an image? What’s the meaning of a phrase in a different language? For such tasks, there often isn’t a set of pre-defined rules a computer program can use to make trusted predictions. Instead, most of today’s AI tools rely on machine learning (ML) models for prediction. AI/ML tools, in the words of Google’s Cassie Kozykrov, are essentially scalable “data labelers”. 

ML models make predictions based on patterns in historical data. These patterns are surfaced during model training phase because they are more correlated to the outcome, or label, in the given observations. Cassie Kozykrov likens training a machine learning model to a chef learning a recipe. This is a great analogy: in the case of a Twitter sentiment model, the model is following a recipe that it “learned” about positivity versus negativity in tweets, one that is based on the factors that drove sentiment in the historical tweets contained in the training set. An ML model is thus only capable of making sound predictions in the real world when things closely resemble the training data. This generalization problem is one of the most impactful, pervasive, and talked about constraints of AI and machine learning models today. The ramifications: The importance of training data for AI cannot be understated enough. 

You need great datasets to develop AI tools. In our tooling-enabled world, everyone has access to the same “near” state-of-the-art models, such as XGBoost (common architecture for tabular) and Transformers (common architecture for natural language, vision, reinforcement learning). They’re both open-sourced and used avidly across enterprise data science. The leaders of AI integration are differentiated, as a result, due to their datasets (data quality, scope, signal, commercial value, governance, importance/relevance to important business functions, etc.). The old adage “more data beats better models, but better data beats more data” is a core tenant of AI and machine learning. 

With the basics under our belt, let’s dive into how startup fundamentals can best inform AI strategy (and how I’ve employed them in previous data science projects).
