In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel shares the fundamentals that he believes most succesful technology companies share in common. The key takeaway: startups should exude these fundamentals - otherwise, red flags. Here's why startup fundamentals are also relevant to productizing Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, lessons learned from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the integration of AI tools. While recent advances in tooling indeed enable AI-powered transformation, you need more than access to Python packages to succeed. The lifeline of a commercial AI project is its potential for value creation. Models should be automating tasks, augmenting analyses, enabling features, surfacing information, or otherwise creating value to important workstreams. If models are sitting idle, your company is not quite there yet. And, frequently, the use-case wasnâ€™t a viable match for AI in the first place (Cassie K., steps to an AI project). How to find viable AI use-cases? It turns out that staying true to Thiel's startup fundamentals goes a long way in ensuring that your AI integration adequately attends to value creation potential.

* Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of computer/data science that largely concerns itself with the application of machine learning (ML) models for predictive tasks. Here, I refer to AI and ML synonymously. Common AI/ML tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.
