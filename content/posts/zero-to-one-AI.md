In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The key takeaway: technology startups should exude seven pivotal fundamentals – otherwise, red flags. Here's why the startup mentality is also relevant to productizing AI solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

It's not difficult to see the parallels between founding a technology startup and a digital transformation. In both, you're setting out to generate untapped value with technology. For many companies, integrating AI tools can be a powerful aspect of digital transformation (through developing or buying tools). According to Silvio Palumbo, a data science consultant at BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the “smart integration” of AI tools (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). 

Recent advances in tooling have enabled integration of AI tools into most business digital transformations. While enabled by advances in tooling, the commercial success of AI integration often hinges on tools' ability to generate untapped value for the business. This is akin to the goals of a technology startup on a high-level, to create products that revolutionize our ways of doing things (i.e., generating untapped value in the world). 

AI models can create value by automating tasks, powering features, augmenting analyses, surfacing information, or by otherwise making predictions in the wild (see Figure 1 for a schematic of common AI use-cases). If models sit idle, you’re AI integration is not quite there yet. And, frequently AI projects fail because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation). 

The salient question for your AI integration becomes: How to find the most valuable tools to integrate given the commercial context? In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI integration projects goes a long way in helping your team answer this critical question. Ultimately, developing AI tools with the seven fundamentals in mind results in more succesful projects because the value creation component of productizing technology is given adequate attention, AI projects' lifeline to commercial success (and buy-in from business executives).
