In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the strategies that successful technology startups share in common. The key takeaway: technology startups should exude seven business fundamentals – otherwise, red flags. Here's why these mentalities are also relevant to productizing AI solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, via lessons learned from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the integration of AI tools. While recent advances in tooling indeed enable AI-powered transformation, you need more than access to Python packages and cloud data services to generate outsized returns on your AI investment.  

The most important component of a commercial AI project is its potential to create untapped business value (in terms of future cash flow). Models should be automating tasks, augmenting analyses, enabling features, surfacing information, or be otherwise poised to create value for important business workstreams. If models are sitting idle, you’re not quite there yet. And, frequently, models are idle because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation). 

The salient question: how to find the best AI use-cases in your business? It turns out that staying true to Thiel's startup fundamentals goes a long way in ensuring that your AI strategy adequately attends to the potential for value creation, the lifeline to commercial success (and to making your business executives happy).

* Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of computer/data science that largely concerns itself with the application of machine learning (ML) models for predictive tasks. Here, I refer to AI and ML synonymously. Common AI/ML tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.
