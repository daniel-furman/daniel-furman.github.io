In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the core fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The takeaway: startups should exude seven pivotal traits – otherwise, queue red flags. Here's why your data science team should also exude the mentality of a technology startup to win at AI innovation, from the perspective of a data scientist in digital strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

The parallels between technology startups and digital transformation are numerous. In both, the overarching goal is to create value through novel applications of technology. And, today, integrating AI tools is more frequently a component of digital transformation (and, as it turns out, technology startups). According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, companies of all shapes and sizes are posed to find a "competitive advantage" through the “Smart Integration” of AI tools in the 2020s (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). 

And, while largely enabled by better AI tooling, the bottom-line success of AI innovation still hinges on value creation fundamentals. Just as the "unicorn" startup in a VC fund is more valuable than all others in the fund combined, an AI solution plugged into the "unicorn" use-case creates more value than all other potential solutions combined. 

The salient question becomes: What is the most promising opportunity for AI integration given the commercial context? 

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI development helps your team attend to that question early on and often throughout a project. Ultimately, developing tools with these seven fundamentals in mind results in products that have stronger and more consistent opportunities for value creation, the lifeline to success in AI innovation (and, usually, buy-in from executives).

## A primer on AI

Firstly, what’s AI? Yes, the term is well-known. And, while you’ve probably heard of Artificial Intelligence, let’s clearly define its practical meaning for digital transformation and innovation. Loosely speaking, AI refers to computer programs that automate predictive tasks, types of tasks that were previously confined to human intuition (hence “Artificial” Intelligence). Such tools, in the words of Google’s Cassie Kozykrov, are essentially scalable data labelers. What’s the sentiment of this tweet? What’s contained in this image? What’s the meaning of this phrase in a different language? These are the kinds of data labeling tasks AI tools can automate. 

For such tasks, there often isn’t a good set of pre-defined rules a computer program can use to make predictions. Instead, most of today’s AI tools rely on machine learning models to make predictions. Such models make predictions based on patterns in historical data that correlate to an outcome, or label. Cassie Kozykrov, in her well-known course “Making Friends with Machine Learning”, likens training a machine learning model to a chef learning a recipe. In the case of a Twitter sentiment model, the model is attending to a recipe it has “learned” about positivity versus negativity in tweets, a recipe that is solely based on factors that drove sentiment in the historical tweets it was trained on. Therefore, a machine learning model is only capable of making sound predictions on data in the wild that closely resembles its training data, one of the most powerful constraints of AI and machine learning. Long story short, AI has a generalization problem due to how models are trained. 

Thus, the importance of quality training data for AI development cannot be understated. You need great datasets to develop good AI tools. In our tooling-enabled world, everyone has access to XGBoost (a common architecture for tabular machine learning) and Transformers (a common architecture for natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning). As follows, the leaders of AI integration are almost solely differentiated from the pack due to their higher-quality training data. The old adage “more data beats better models, but better data beats more data” is a core tenant of AI and machine learning. 

With the basics under our belt, let’s dive into how startup fundamentals inform AI strategy.
