In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The key takeaway: technology startups should exude seven pivotal fundamentals – otherwise, red flags. Here's why the startup mentality is also relevant to productizing AI solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

It's not difficult to see the parallels between founding a technology startup and kickstarting a digital transformation. In both situations, you're setting out to create value in new ways. Just how Airbnb created a market for in-home vacation stays, a company's digital transformation is aimed at creating new ways of doing things. 

According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the “smart integration” of AI tools, which can be viewed as a piece of the digital transformation puzzle (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). While recent advances in tooling enable AI-powered digital transformation, you need more than access to Python packages and cloud data services to generate outsized returns on an AI investment.  

The success of commercial AI often hinges on the tools' ability to generate untapped value (or lack thereof). Models can create value by automating tasks, powering features, augmenting analyses, surfacing information, or by otherwise making predictions in the wild. If models are idle, you’re not quite there yet. And, frequently projects fail because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation). 

The salient question becomes: How to find the right AI use-cases given the commercial context. 

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI integration yields adequate attention to the value creation component of a project, its lifeline to commercial success and buy-in from business executives.
