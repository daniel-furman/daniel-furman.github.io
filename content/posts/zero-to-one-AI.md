In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel shares the fundamentals that he believes most succesful technology companies share in common. The key take-away: startups should exude these fundamentals - otherwise, red flags. Here's why startup fundamentals are also relavent to productizing Artifical Inteligence (AI) solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, lessons learned from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find "competitive advantage" through the application of AI tools that "fit their specific data, technology, and talent context." Integrating AI solutions in a commercial context largely comes down to the communication and execution of a sound strategy, one centered on the potential for value creation. While recent advances in tooling enable AI transformation, the bottom-line success of any commercial AI solution is indeed measured in terms of value created - there should be a link from a business's AI tooling to the generation of untapped dollars. AI should be automating tasks, augmenting analyses, enabling features, surfacing information, or be otherwise creating value for important workstreams. If models are sitting idle, you’re company is not quite there yet. And, frequently, the given use-case wasn’t truly viable in the first place (Cassie K., steps to an AI project). How to find viable use-cases? It turns out that staying faithful to startup fundamentals ensures that your AI strategy obsesses over potential value creation above all else, the key to success. 

Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of computer/data science that largely concerns itself with the application of machine learning (ML) models for predictive tasks. Here, I refer to AI and ML synonymously. Common AI/ML tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.
