In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores seven core fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The key takeaway: startups should exude these seven pivotal traits – otherwise, red flags. Here's why your data science innovations teams should also exude the mentality of a technology startup, from the perspective of a data scientist in digital strategy consulting.

## Introduction

<br><br>

It's not difficult to see parallels between technology startups and digital transformation. The over-arching goal in both is to create value through the application of technology. And, today, integrating AI tools is more frequently a component of digital transformation (and, as it turns out, technology startups). According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, companies of all shapes and sized today are posed to find a "competitive advantage" through the “Smart Integration” of AI tools (insert Silvio Palumbo citation). The lure of "outsized returns" has caused a frenzy of interest in AI and machine learning (AI/ML). Ask an executive if they are searching for ways to integrate AI into their business. Odds are, the answer is “yes, …”.  

While enabled by better tooling, the bottom-line commercial success of AI/ML innovation still hinges on value creation fundamentals. The AI/ML tool plugged into a "unicorn" use-case often follows a value creation power law: the "unicorn" application creates more value than all other potential solutions combined, just as the "unicorn" startup in a VC fund is more valuable than all others combined. 

The salient question for your data science innovations team becomes: What is the most promising opportunity for AI integration given the commercial context, one with a large potential for value creation? 

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI/ML development enables your team to answer that question early on and throughout a project. Ultimately, developing tools with these seven startup fundamentals in mind results in stronger and more consistent opportunities for value creation, the lifeline to commercial success in digital transformation (and, usually, buy-in from executives).

What’s AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML)? AI …

They can be automating tasks at scale, powering new features, augmenting analyses, surfacing important information, or otherwise making predictions in the wild that are useful to workstreams. If models sit idle, you’re AI integration is not quite there yet. And, frequently AI projects fail because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation).
