In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the fundamentals that most successful startups share in common. The key takeaway: technology startups should exude seven business fundamentals – otherwise, there are red flags. Here's why the startup mentality is also relevant to productizing AI solutions in businesses of all shapes and sizes, from the perspective of a data scientist in strategy consulting.

## Introduction

According to Silvio Palumbo of BCG Gamma, most companies today are poised to find a "competitive advantage" through the “smart integration” of AI tools. While recent advances in tooling indeed enable AI-powered transformation, you need much more than access to Python packages and cloud data services to generate outsized returns on your AI investment.

One of the most important components to the commercial success of an AI project? – its potential to create untapped value (in terms of future cash flow). Models should automate tasks, power features, augment analyses, surface information, or be otherwise positioned to create value. If models are sitting idle, you’re not quite there yet. And, frequently, models are idle because the use-case wasn’t a good match for AI in the first place (insert Cassie K. citation).

The salient question becomes: How to find the best AI use-cases given your commercial context?

In this blog post, I argue that applying Thiel's startup fundamentals to AI integration enables you to adequately attend to the value creation component of your AI project, the lifeline to commercial success and overall buy-in from business executives.

* Definitions: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a sub-field of data science that largely concerns itself with the application of machine learning (ML) models for predictive tasks. Here, I refer to AI and ML synonymously. Common AI/ML tasks include auto-completing the next phrase in a text, recommending friends on social media, recognizing misinformation online, tailoring online ads, translating between languages, etcetera.
