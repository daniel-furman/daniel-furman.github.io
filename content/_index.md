# About

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily interested in applied modeling and insights-oriented analytics. My programming experience is robust in Python and R, spanning the full-DS-stack from unsupervised mining to algorithm development in the cloud. 

I specialize in applied data science and machine learning at UC Berkeley's School of Information (MIMS '23). Previously, I studied geophysics and mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania (BA '20). I also love reading about all things science, promoting environmental conservation, and telling engaging stories with data!
