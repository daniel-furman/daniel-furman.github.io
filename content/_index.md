## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily focused on predictive analytics. I am specialized in probabalistic machine learning and geospatial modeling.  

My professional experience is mainly in Python and R, spanning the full-stack from data mining to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, backpacking & camping, rock climbing, playing guitar, reading, and building apps and OSS.
