# Hi there. I'm Daniel 👋 

## <ins>Bio </ins>

I'm a Data Scientist with experience in digital strategy consulting and technology startups, looking to delve deeper into AI/ML integration in commercial use-cases. Proficient with "full stack" Data Science including building data pipelines, productizing machine learning models, defining analytics/metrics, and visualizing data.

Skills & Interests:<br>
👨‍💻 Deep understanding of software dev tools such as Python, AWS, Git, R, SQL<br>
🚀 Excited about building MVPs collaboratively (system design, reproducibility)<br>
🌱 Fascinated by geospatial data, natural language, and digital transformation<br>
💡 Ethos: "More data over better models, better data over more data, 80:20 rule"<br>

Fun Fact:<br>
⛳️ Former co-captain @Harvard-Westlake golf, teammate @UPenn golf<br>
