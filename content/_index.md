## Hello there üëã

I am currently a Data Scientist at West Monroe, expanding what‚Äôs possible with data in business consulting. I completed my Master's in Information Management & Systems at UC Berkeley and my Bachelor's in Mathematics at Penn. Throughout my career, I have applied machine learning across modalities (tabular, text, images, geospatial) and verticals (high-tech & software, M&A, IT strategy).
