## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily interested in predictive analytics and scalable modeling pipelines. My professional experience is mainly in Python and R, spanning the full-stack from ETL to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, backpacking & camping, rock climbing, playing guitar, reading, and building things.

## Development:

- Surf crowd prediction app via computer vision and ML.
- OSS for Kaggle competitions and my data science blog.

## Research:

- Geospatial machine learning of ecological systems (Harvey Mudd College; NSF funded). [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jW5UdWHRNENrrShfqS_SKvMWY0Br4737/view?usp=sharing)] [[Code](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs)]
- Experimental geophysics of ice sheet rheology (UPenn Ice Physics Lab, CURF funded). [[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eO1_V15OF7_nOsCQJZYziCa7rR9L49gH/view?usp=sharing)] [[Code](https://github.com/daniel-furman/ice-densification-research)]
