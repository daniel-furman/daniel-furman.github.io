# About

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily interested in predictive analytics and probabilistic machine learning. My professional experience is mainly in Python and R, spanning the full-stack from data mining to algorithm development.

In my spare time I enjoy surfing, golfing, climbing, playing guitar, reading, and volunteering.
