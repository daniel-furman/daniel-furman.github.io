## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily focused on predictive analytics via machine learning.

My professional experience is mainly in Python and R, spanning the full-stack from statistical modeling to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, camping, rock climbing, playing guitar, avidly reading, and building new things.
