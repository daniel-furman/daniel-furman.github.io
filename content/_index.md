## Hello there üëã

Great data science is about developing effective tools that solve core business problems. I'm passionate about building systems that increase operational efficiencies and enable smarter decision-making. 

At present, I'm a member of the `analytics` team at West Monroe, expanding what‚Äôs possible with data science in strategy consulting. I have an MS in data science from UC Berkeley and a BA from UPenn. I enjoy applying ML across modalities (natural language, vision, geospatial) and industries (high-tech & software, M&A, IT strategy).
