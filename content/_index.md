## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily focused on predictive analytics. I am specialized in probabilistic machine learning and geospatial modeling.  

My professional experience is mainly in Python and R, spanning the full-stack from data mining to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, backpacking & camping, rock climbing, playing guitar, reading, and building apps and OSS.

## Developing:

- An app for surf crowd predictionn via computer vision and ML.
- Statistical modeling OSS for Kaggle competitions.
- A proof of stake Substrate blockchain for Eco Action.

## Research:

- Geospatial modeling for ecological systems (Harvey Mudd College). [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jW5UdWHRNENrrShfqS_SKvMWY0Br4737/view?usp=sharing)] [[Code](https://github.com/daniel-furman/PySDMs)]
- Experimental geophysics for ice sheet rheology (UPenn Ice Physics Lab). [[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eO1_V15OF7_nOsCQJZYziCa7rR9L49gH/view?usp=sharing)] [[Code](https://github.com/daniel-furman/ice-densification-research)]
