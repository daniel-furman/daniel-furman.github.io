# About Me

A challenge-driven data scientist interested in applied modeling and analytics. Extracting data-driven insights that help organizations make better decisions.

My programming experience is deep in Python and R, spanning the full-DS-stack from data mining to algorithm development. I am currently studying applied data science and machine learning at UC Berkeley's School of Information (MIMS '23). As an undergraduate, I studied geophysics and mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania (BA '20). In my spare time, I love reading about science, promoting environmental conservation, and telling communicable stories with data!
