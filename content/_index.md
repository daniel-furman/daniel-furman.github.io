# Hi there, I'm Daniel 👋 

## <ins>Bio </ins>

I am a Data Scientist at West Monroe, leading a team of technologists to accelerate high-ROI applications of natural language processing (NLP) in business consulting. 
<br>
Proficient with "full stack" Data Science development including data pipelines, applied analytics, data visualization, machine learning, and containerized applications. 
<br>
My unique skillset brings a mix of software, product, and business know-how. These were honed through experience in digital strategy consulting, technology startups, and academic research. Going forward, I am looking to delve deeper into analytics enablement in commercial settings as well as digital transformation and AI strategy more generally.
