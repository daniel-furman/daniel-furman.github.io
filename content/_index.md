# <ins>Bio</ins>

I am a data scientist at West Monroe, where I spearhead a team of technology consultants applying natural language processing (NLP) methods in commercial analytics. My skillset brings a blend of software engineering, data analytics, and business know-how. It was honed through a diversity of work experience in strategy consulting firms, tech startups, and academic research labs. I am proficient with “full stack” data science development including blends of data pipelines, applied analytics, data visualizations, machine learning, and containerized applications. Going forward, I intend to delve deeper into analytics enablement in digital transformation contexts.
