# About Me

I’m a UC Berkeley data scientist looking to apply my mathematics background towards democratizing data analytics and applied modeling for businesses of all sizes. My experience includes leading initiatives in business intelligence, software development, and academic research. These projects have resulted in actionable insights into business strategy, productionized code for machine learning software, and academic publications in mathematical biology and geophysics. I’m comfortable using Git for version control and have a deep understanding of Python, R, and SQL as well as cloud data technologies such as AWS and GCP. In addition, as a former co-captain of the Harvard-Westlake golf team and former member of UPenn’s NCAA D1 golf team, I have a strong appreciation for high performance teams and what it takes to make them function efficiently. Overall, I believe I add value to an engineering team because my technical capabilities are matched by my excellent communication skills and aptitude for hypothesis-driven research.
