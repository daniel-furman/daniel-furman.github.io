# About Me

I’m a data scientist harnessing my mathematics background to democratize data analytics and machine learning solutions in business of all sizes. My experience includes leading initiatives in business intelligence, software development, and academic research. These have resulted in actionable insights into organizational and product strategy, productionized code for machine learning software, and academic publications in mathematical biology and geophysics. Overall, I’m comfortable using Git for version control and have a deep understanding of Python, R, and SQL as well as cloud data technologies such as AWS and GCP. In addition, as a former co-captain of the Harvard-Westlake golf team and former member of UPenn’s NCAA D1 golf team, I have a strong appreciation for high performance teams and what it takes to make them function efficiently.
