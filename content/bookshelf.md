Eiger Dreams, Venturing Among Men and Mountains | Jon Krakauer | 2018 | "Most climbers aren't in fact deranged, they're just infected with a particularly virulent strain of the Human Condition."
Why Buddhism is True, The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment | Robert Wright | 2019 | "In fact, one big lesson from Buddhism is to be suspicious of the intuition that your ordinary way of perceiving the world brings you the truth about it."
