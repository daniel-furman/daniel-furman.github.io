## A small (but growing) record of my favorite reads.

Book | Author | Finished | Quotes
-----|-------|-------|-------
Why Buddhism is True, The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment | Robert Wright | 2019 | "In fact, one big lesson from Buddhism is to be suspicious of the intuition that your ordinary way of perceiving the world brings you the truth about it."
Eiger Dreams, Venturing Among Men and Mountains | Jon Krakauer | 2018 | "Most climbers aren't in fact deranged, they're just infected with a particularly virulent strain of the Human Condition."
