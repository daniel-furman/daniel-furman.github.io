Intro Results of a final project for deep RL at UCB in fall &amp;lsquo;22. Our team was interested in pursuing research directions in a niche field of computer vision / remote sensing with two studies to date. These papers suggest that applying deep RL agents to hyperspectral band selection was advantageous; however, here we show that we can get comparable results with random samples across four types of deep RL agents.</description></item><item><title>Why startup fundamentals are key to AI strategy.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/zero-to-one-ai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/zero-to-one-ai/</guid><description>Why startup fundamentals are key to AI strategy Using the “technology startup mentality” to integrate technology in commercial contexts Published in Towards Data Science In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the core fundamentals that successful technology startups have in common. The takeaway: startups should embrace seven pivotal traits — otherwise, queue red flags. Here’s why great AI innovation projects also exhibit the fundamentals of successful technology startups, from the perspective of a Bay Area data scientist working in digital strategy consulting.</description></item><item><title>Field experiment on dating attitudes towards academic prestige.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/tinder_field_experiment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/tinder_field_experiment/</guid><description>Field experiment on dating attitudes towards academic prestige in the Bay Area. By Daniel Furman, Forrest Brandt, and Jackie Hu Berkeley Spring 2022, Causal Inference with Prof. Josue Martinez Objective How significant is one’s academic prestige for online dating in the Bay Area? Are dating attitudes towards academic achievements different between men and women in the Bay Area?
The widespread adoption of online dating apps enables social scientists to perform field experiments probing the underlying psychology of human dating, for example, how social attractiveness influences dating dynamics.</description></item><item><title>Extracting metadata from social media captions with machine learning.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/social-media-profiling-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/social-media-profiling-blog/</guid><description>A blog post &amp;amp; Web-App exploring social media profiling with machine learning.

Overview: This design doc’s purpose is to provide a write-up for the corresponding web-application above. Profiling metadata is valuable for a range of purposes, such as for creating better personalized advertisements online. However, this is clearly a sensitive topic, because people have a range of both positive and negative opinions about internet privacy.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing 40,000+ celebrity Tweets, IG captions &amp; FB posts with RShiny.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/social-media-nlp-viz/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/social-media-nlp-viz/</guid><description>A highly scientific visualization of 40k+ celebrity Twitter, Instagram &amp;amp; Facebook posts.

Made with the support of the Risk &amp;amp; Resilience DAT/Artathon 2021.
“EcoRisk California” explores climate change impacts for three of the West Coast’s most beloved tree species during the 21st century. The motion-graphics storyboard visualizes shifts within three species distributions across spatial and climate dimensions, exploring relationships between ecological risk and habitat suitability. To facilitate future experiments, the study is accompanied by an open-sourced Python package containing the class for semi-automated machine learning used in the visualization.</description></item><item><title>BirdCLEF21 Kaggle Competition Write Up.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/birdclef21-kaggle-competition-write-up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/birdclef21-kaggle-competition-write-up/</guid><description>BirdCLEF21 Kaggle Competition Write Up. [Code] The BirdCLEF21 Kaggle challenge brought state of the art in computer vision to bird song recognition, tasking competitors to classify species from bird calls into 397 target classes. The competition&amp;rsquo;s focus on actionable biodiversity outcomes was particularly exciting (given my interest in the environment and drive-train deployment).
Intro I blended several audio-based Neural Network Models (RNNs) taking up to 10 spectrogram representations of 7-sec segments per bird call file.</description></item><item><title>Using Numerical Mathematics to Approximate the Golden Ratio.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</guid><description>Using Numerical Mathematics to Approximate the Golden Ratio Introduction and historical context I will approximate the golden ratio by iteratively taking ratios of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence. This algorithm lets us peer into the underlying relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, illuminating a number of interesting patterns.
The golden ratio is a mathematical phenomenon between two numbers, say, a and b. Let a &amp;gt; b, if the ratio of $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is the same as $$\frac{(a+b)}{a}$$, then the ratio is ~$$\frac{1.</description></item><item><title>Solving a Partnership Restructuring Problem with a Search Model.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:22:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</guid><description>Solving a Partnership Restructuring Problem with a Search Model. Intro Consider a partnership restructuring its assets into majority ownerships among N partners, who previously shared M assets unevenly (debt + value). The asset structure directly reflects the partners&amp;rsquo; differing ownership stakes in the business. Here, I aimed to re-distribute the assets into majority ownerships without altering the partnership stakes, minimizing potential restructuring taxes levied if the asset ownerships changed significantly between partners.</description></item><item><title>Bookshelf</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/bookshelf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/bookshelf/</guid><description>Favorite Reads Book Author Finished Quotes There are places in the world where rules are less important than kindness Carlo Rovelli 2022 &amp;ldquo;Everything exists only through dependence on something else.&amp;rdquo; Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future Peter Thiel 2022 &amp;ldquo;Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.&amp;rdquo; Becoming Wild: How Animal Cultures Raise Families, Create Beauty, and Achieve Peace Carl Safina 2022 &amp;ldquo;The philosopher Immanuel Kant asserted, &amp;ldquo;Man is the only being who needs education.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Contact dryanfurman (at) gmail
