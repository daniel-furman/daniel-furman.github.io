A data-driven story about ecological risk across California that highlights large amounts of climatic change in the American west. Add temperature rise () and worsening drought () to the list of risks faced by the three iconic species, which also include wildfire, logging, pollution, resource depletion, and urban expansion across the west coast.

[Code] Bird song recognition with AI has the potential to streamline (by semi-automating) scientific monitoring of bird assemblages. Faster identification of bird species in natural settings, as a result, equips land managers and policy-makers with a stronger understanding of environmental risks in ecological systems. The BirdCLEF21 Kaggle challenge brought state of the art in computer vision to bird song recognition, tasking competitors to classify species from bird calls into 397 target classes.</description></item><item><title>Numerical Math Mondays: Approximating the golden ratio.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</guid><description>Numerical Math Mondays: Approximating the golden ratio.
The first in hopefully what will be many Numerical Math Mondays. My goal for this series of posts is to dive back into the numerical mathematics topics I learned during my undergraduate studies. I am a huge fan of 3blue1brown, and so, I am looking to pay particular attention to the visual side of the mathematics, as well as the computational.</description></item><item><title>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:22:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</guid><description>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes. Consider a partnership restructuring its assets. The N partners currently share each of the M assets at a given percentage. Our task is to re-distribute the assets such that each is under majority ownership. Critically, we need to divvy the assets without altering the overall value and debt associated with each partner. In effect, we want to split up the assets fairly.</description></item><item><title>Bookshelf</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/bookshelf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/bookshelf/</guid><description>Favorite Reads Book Author Finished Quotes Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World David Epstein 2021 &amp;ldquo;Seeing small pieces of a larger jigsaw puzzle in isolation, no matter how hi-def the picture, is insufficient to grapple with humanity&amp;rsquo;s greatest challenges.&amp;rdquo; Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction Philip E.
