Bird song recognition with AI has the potential to semi-automate bird assemblage monitoring, equipping scientists with more streamlined insights into environmental risk. The BirdCLEF21 Kaggle challenge involved species classification on bird calls, with 397 target species for training classes. The competition's focus on actionable biodiversity outcomes was particularly exciting (given my interest in drive-train deployment). As a result, I very thoroughly enjoyed the time I put into BirdCLEF21.</description></item><item><title>Numerical Math Mondays: Approximating the golden ratio.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/numerical-math-mondays-approximating-the-golden-ratio/</guid><description>Numerical Math Mondays: Approximating the golden ratio.
The first in hopefully what will be many Numerical Math Mondays. My goal for this series of posts is to dive back into the numerical mathematics topics I learned during my undergraduate studies. I am a huge fan of 3blue1brown, and so, I am looking to pay particular attention to the visual side of the mathematics, as well as the computational.</description></item><item><title>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes.</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:22:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/posts/solving-a-partnership-restructuring-problem-with-computational-linear-algerba/</guid><description>Solving a partnership restructuring problem with Markov processes. Consider a partnership restructuring its assets. The N partners currently share each of the M assets at a given percentage. Our task is to re-distribute the assets such that each is under majority ownership. Critically, we need to divvy the assets without altering the overall value and debt associated with each partner. In effect, we want to split up the assets fairly.</description></item><item><title>Bookshelf</title><link>https://daniel-furman.github.io/bookshelf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daniel-furman.github.io/bookshelf/</guid><description>Favorite Reads Book Author Finished Quotes Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World David Epstein 2021 &amp;ldquo;Seeing small pieces of a larger jigsaw puzzle in isolation, no matter how hi-def the picture, is insufficient to grapple with humanity&amp;rsquo;s greatest challenges.&amp;rdquo; Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction Philip E.
